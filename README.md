# SimpleHTTPServer
Implementing a very basic http server using java.

Followed along a tutorial by [Javin Paul]([url](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2015/06/how-to-create-http-server-in-java-serversocket-example.html)) and made some slight modifications so the code worked as I wanted. 

The Program is able to establish a http connection over port 8080 then display the http header received from the browser to the console. The program then sends back a response which includes the date and a secret message. Finally the program outputs to the console that the connection has been completed along with the connection number.
